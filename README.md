# Food Timeline

> An app to track your food

This project was created to learn Flutter. It will be done without libraries except for development libraries.

The use of no library will make things a bit harder (and longer) to do, but this is the way I like to learn.

## Objectives

The objective of the project is to make possible to take pictures of your food and tag them.

> The idea came up when I started to reeducate my diet and felt the need to track what I was eating, this way I could reduce or change some foods

I intend to build the UI similar to Google Calendar, that has a timeline (aha!) and a calendar to get a macro view of the events. In short terms, it will be a Google Calendar with pictures.

## Platforms

- [ ] Android
- [ ] iOS

> Android will be the first platform because I have more experience with it, for iOS I'll need to learn from scratch
